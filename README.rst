Introduction
============

This package provides custom map view for Plone site root or any other
folderish object. It gets all GEO aware nested objects and shows them
on a map based on Ushahidi user interface. There you can also filter out
objects by keywords, portal types and dates.

Based on the work collective.geo.ushahidi by Vitaliy Podoba.
